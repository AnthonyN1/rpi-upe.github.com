          </p>

          <h4>Programming Competition Grading Server</h4>
          <p>This server powers the RCOS/ACM/UPE semesterly programming competitions. Participants submit solutions to a variety of problems and the server evaluates their algorithms by testing them against a number of input conditions, checking for correctness and time efficiency.
