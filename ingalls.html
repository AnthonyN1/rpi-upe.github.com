      <h2>Robert P. Ingalls Award</h2>
        <p><i>In recognition of exceptional service to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon</i></p>
      
      <h3> Award Description </h3>
        <p>The Robert P. Ingalls award was established to recognize those members of 
        Upsilon Pi Epsilon who, through determination and dedication to the society,
        made lasting and immeasurable contributions to the development and advancement 
        of the chapter. The award may only be awarded to one deserving member per year, 
        but need not be awarded every year; it should be awarded in those cases where 
        an individual's contribution has been worthy of such everlasting recognition.
