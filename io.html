          <h2>Rensselaer UPE I/O Events</h2>
          <p>
            We hold a special lectures series called I/Os multiple times a semester. A UPE I/O is a forum to introduce students to interesting & useful technologies that they would otherwise not come into contact with, in a way that will aid them in growing personally, academically, and professionally. The typical format is to recruit a speaker who is knowledgeable about the technology at hand, and have them give an overview of what it is, what problems it solves, and how to use it.
          <p>

            Go (also Golang) is a new open source language. Initially developed by Google but now a separate software project, it is intended to be a major systems language superior to C++. It features garbage collection, type safety with some dynamic typing, and a large emphasis on concurrency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The language's official site is <a href="http://golang.org">golang.org</a>. You can try Go on the official site or using <a href="http://repl.it/languages/go">repl.it</a>.
